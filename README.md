# Shakespeare's Review Board

I took the chance to make a client page to help William Shakespeare serve his back end API. 

## Function

This page loads up 100 reviews from a server run by Shakespeare of some of his most quotable lines. The page is a very simple single page app with an index of all reviews. I opted not to create a detail page for the reviews due to their small size. Instead, I display the reviews in a responsive grid that goes from 4 -> 2 -> 1 column depending on screen width availability. 

## Style
The design of the page is meant to match Mr. Shakespeare's design tastes. I used images from Unsplash.com for the bust of shakespeare and for the faux-aged paper background for the reviews. I chose a very slanted font to try and create a handwritten feel for the reviews, and a color for the banner and page that suggested these pieces of paper have been nailed up to a wooden board. I chose to translate the review scores into star ratings to give the reviews a more reader-friendly appearance and communicate the information more clearly.  

## Testing

In my testing file I have set up testing of the api call to make sure it correctly loads. This would help me in making modifications to the app to know I am not disrupting the core feature of displaying the reviews by changing my implementation. 

## Thanks
Thanks to Shakespeare for use of his server and to the creators on Unsplash for creating their images.
